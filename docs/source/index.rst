Halvade documentation
=====================

Halvade implements the best-practices pipelines from Broad Institute using the MapReduce framework. Halvade supports pipelines for WGS and Exome sequencing data as well as RNA-seq data. The best-practices pipeline is parallelized using MapReduce where the Map phase performs the read mapping and the Reduce phase takes care of the variant calling with the necessary preprocessnig steps. By using other existing, reliable tools like BWA, STAR, samtools, picard and GATK we ensure that the variants are correctly called. Additionally these tools get frequent updates and Halvade allows simple replacement of the binary file to update the tool.
